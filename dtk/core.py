        handleInput checks the list of keybindings, and for keys
        which are bound, dispatches to the bound method. if a
        binding for 'printable' exists (printable characters are
        letters, numbers, symbols, the space key, tab and enter;
        see isPrintable) the bound method for the 'printable'
        binding will be called. if there is no 'printable' binding
        or if the input fails the isPrintable test, the input's
        dtk friendly name will be looked for in the key binding
        map; if successful, the bound method for that input

        binds 'printable' and any printable character, the letter
        'a' for example, will only ever call the method bound
        to 'printable' when an 'a' arrives as input.

        before calling any bound method, handleInput checks the
        argument list.  if '_input_key' or '_source_obj' exist in the
        argument list and weren't explicitly set to another value at
        binding time, then the translated (see below) input character
        and bound object (ie 'self'), respectively, will be passed to
        the method using those names. if the method does not
        explicitly name '_input_key' or '_source_obj', the extra
        arguments will not be passed, even if the method accepts
        *args or **kwargs.

        (certain keys are represented in dtk with easy-to-use
        names, for example the space character is bound with
        the name 'space', not ' '. when passing a value for
        _input_key, the translated version ' ' will be used. the
        list of translated characters is in the dict
        InputHandler.printableVersion.)

class Drawable(InputHandler):
    """
    Drawable is the base class for on-screen DTK elements. It
    provides implementations and stubs for methods crucial to 
    drawing onscreen "widgets." In general, methods defined
    here should only be called by subclasses or other parts
    of the DTK core.

    This class is a fully concrete class that can be instantiated,
    though it won't do much by itself, unless you need a widget
    which will never draw anything to the screen.
    
    To extend Drawable, subclasses must at least implement the
    render() function. render() is called whenever it is time
    to redraw the widget, and should use the drawing methods
    (draw, drawDown, line, lineDown, clear and box) defined here
    rather than directly calling the versions of same in Engine.
    These methods all take positional arguments relative to the
    origin, the upper-left, of the Drawable.

    touch(), untouch() and drawContents() are used by DTK core to
    control when render is called. Render will be called by
    drawContents only if the object has been touched by a call to
    touch(). untouch() is the inverse of touch(). Sub-classes will
    generally not need to override any of these methods.

    setSize is used by DTK core to set the size of the widget.
    after it is called, the instance attributes y, x, h, and w are
    set to the on screen origin (y, x) and the size (h, w) of the
    Drawable. These should not be changed from within sub-classes.
    Some drawables which do not wish to take up the entire space
    allotted for them by DTK core may override setSize. 

    Finally, each Drawable has a reference to the Engine and the
    context in which it exists. For more information on input
    contexts, see the documentation in InputContext and Engine.
    Drawables may check the focused attribute to determine if
    they are currently the focused Drawable in their context. Some
    Drawables use this value to change their drawing style: ListBox
    shows the active highlighted row in reverse-colors when it has
    focus, and normally when it does not, creating a cursor only
    when the ListBox has focus.

    Events:
     * 'got focus' when this Drawable gains focus
     * 'lost focus' when this Drawable loses focus
     * 'became active' when this Drawable is on an active path (see
       becameActive())
     * 'became inactive' when this Drawable is no longer on an
       active path (see becameInactive())

         of children. if it gets through all of them without
         getting True or finding the drawable, then it returns
         False, leaving the active reference as it was 
    * getActiveDrawable():
       * if active reference is a Drawable, return it
       * otherwise call getActiveDrawable() on the active child 
    * getActivePath():

    in the active path, then the previous active path below self
    should be notified that it is no longer active, and the new
    active path should be notified that it is now active.

    The default state of active for a Container is up to the
    container to decide; pick something sensible for each.

    Additionally, containers need to define a drawContents()
    method which calls the container's children's drawContents()
    methods as appropriate to the container.

    Containers should also override setSize(...) from Drawable
    in a way appropriate to the container.
