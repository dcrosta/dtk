         getting True or finding the drawable, then it returns
         False, leaving the active reference as it was

       * if active reference is a Drawable, return it

    status among their children (ie nextRow() in Rows) can update
    the active reference; if the Rows is on the active path, then
    the new child is automatically focused. When doing this,
    Containers should call getActivePath() on Engine; if self is
    in the active path, then the previous active path below self
    should be notified that it is no longer active, and the new
    active path should be notified that it is now active.

    The default state of active for a Container is up to the
    container to decide; pick something sensible for each.

    Additionally, containers need to define a drawContents()
    method which calls the container's children's drawContents()
    methods as appropriate to the container.

    Containers should also override setSize(...) from Drawable
    in a way appropriate to the container.
