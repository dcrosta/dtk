    Select is a widget which looks like a button when
    unfocused, and shows a horizontal list of choices
    when focused. The list will take up as much room as
    is available to be drawn or as is needed.

    The left and right keys will move the selection on
    the Select (each time firing the 'selection changed'
    event), but the user must hit Enter to choose an
    option (this will fire the 'clicked') event.

    The selected/highlighted item will be shown in reverse
    colors; the chosen item (which may be different than
    the selected item when the user moves the selection
    but hasn't hit enter) will be bold.
